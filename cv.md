# About myself #

  I am 30 years old, I have changed 3 professions, and now the sanctions are forcing me to do it for the fourth time.
  I can not accurately determine the level of my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS and English language. But I am determined to reach a high level in it, since I fully support the statement that education should not be for life, but through life.
